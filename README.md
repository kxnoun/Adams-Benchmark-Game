# Adam's Benchmark Game
## Introduction
Hello, I'm Adam! Thank you for taking your time to read this. I've wanted to create my own personal project for quite a while now, but studies has kept me very busy for quite a while. Finally I have created my first ever personal project. For the past year, I have had many university projects that required me to make simple games using both Python and Java, so I decided to make my own during my reading week.

This project is the first step in my journey to discovering myself in the world of programming and computer science!

## Overview
This repository contains the files of my very own game, "Adam's Benchmark Game", which is written completely in Python (using the pygame library). Additionally, this repository contains a text file containing over 370,000 words which is taken from [this repository.](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
